Hey! I'm Lumirelle, a developer who wants to learn every kind of technology and share what I've learned with the world.

My dream is to become a full-stack developer who can build amazing applications from scratch and contribute to open-source projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and tools, find the [right ones](/use) for me to get faster and more efficient.

I also love reading tech blogs, watching tutorials, and participating in coding challenges. Let's say together: **Learning is never ending!**
