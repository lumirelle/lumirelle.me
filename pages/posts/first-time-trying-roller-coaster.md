It was my first time trying a roller coaster. I never tried anything so exciting and terrifying 😱.

When you sat down and then the coaster 🎢 started, you never know what will happen next. The coaster just speeds up
suddenly, and the rail goes up and down, left and right, let rollers go upside down, and even make you feel like flying
in the air then crash into the earth's core. This feeling of weightlessness and helplessness is definitely terrifying. I
felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.

The whole process can be very short, but it feels like a lifetime. The first part let me feel like I'm going to die, and
it almost broke down me in the last part, but when it ended peacefully, I had never felt so brave and excited in my
life. After this experience, I feel that I have finally taken the first step towards growth.

Just like Yu Hua's books, _I'm as timid as a mouse_ 🐁. All my courage comes from do something that goes "beyond" the
bounds, such as stay up later, procrastinate until the deadline, play video games and let characters do what I dare not
do. Like Bronya Rand in _Honkai: Star Rail_, the most outrageous thing we have ever done is to say "I will, on behalf of
the will of the architects, thrust this spear into your nose".

Tell the truth, I have never been so clearly aware that the trembling and anxiety when facing feat is not cowardice, but
a normal physiological reaction. It is only when one is afraid of facing fear themselves that on can be considered
cowardly.

Now, I take the first step 👣 to face my fears, and I gain the initial courage 🥊 to take more steps in the future. Just take
care of this courage, let it grow up healthily, and it will definitely become a strong power that can support me to face
more challenges in the future.
